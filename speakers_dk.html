					<h2>Speakers</h2>
					<p>We are looking for speakers, and that includes you! If you are passionate about some Ruby or Rails (or Merb, etc.)-related topic, 
						we'd love to hear what's on your mind. Talks can be 30 minutes or an hour in length. If you are interested in speaking, 
						<a href="speaker_form.html" class="bold">fill out the form!</a>.</p>

						<li id="michael_bleigh">
							<a class="name" href="http://www.mbleigh.com/">Michael Bleigh</a> is a web developer currently living near 
							Ann Arbor, MI specializing in Ruby on Rails and advanced user interface design. He is currently working for 
							<a href="http://www.intridea.com/">Intridea</a>, an agile software development firm based in Washington D.C.
							<h4>Talk: Hacking the Mid-End: Advanced Rails UI Techniques</h4>
							<p>A discussion of the growing development area that lies in between the
							front and back ends of web applications using real code examples of
							advanced user interface design and construction. From Lowpro behaviors
							to block-accepting helpers and interface abstraction, the field for
							'Mid-End' developers is coming into its own right.</p>
						</li>
						<li id="larry_karnowski">
							<a class="name" href="http://thinkrelevance.com">Larry Karnowski</a> has been designing and developing software 
							applications—mostly network management tools—for 
							almost fifteen years. His biggest passion is solving problems for real people—creating user interfaces that 
							let users kick ass. In addition to hard technical skills like Ruby, Java, etc., he brings experience in 
							usability, product design, and uncovering what users really need.
							<h4>Talk: Usability on Rails: Tips &amp; Tricks for Creating Passionate Users</h4>
							<p>A brief introduction to usability for developers, including concrete code examples that solve common usability 
							problems in Rails.</p>
						</li>
						<li id="jim_weirich">
							<a class="name" href="http://onestepback.org/">Jim Weirich</a> is the Chief Scientist for 
							<a href="http://theedgecase.com/home">EdgeCase LLC</a>, a Rails development firm located in Columbus Ohio. Jim has 
							over twenty-five years of experience in software development. He has worked with real-time data systems for testing 
							jet engines, networking software for information systems, and image processing software for the financial industry. 
							Jim is active in the Ruby community and has contributed to several Ruby projects, including the Rake build system 
							and the RubyGems package software. 
							<h4>Talk: Playing it Safe - How to write library friendly code in Ruby</h4>
							<p>Ruby's incredibly flexible language features puts a great deal of responsibility on the programmer to use 
							them in a safe manner. This talk will discuss when it is appropriate to use these feature and when it might 
							be better to "play it safe".  Also discuss future language features such as "selector namespaces" and how 
							they effect programming styles.</p>

							<h4>Talk: Just Enough Programming</h4>
							<p>Are you tired of over architected applications?  Does infinite
							scalability imply infinite development time?  Are you surrounded by
							applications whose sole goal is to be buzzword compliant?  Do you
							suffer indigestion from the "extra sauce" that makes the management
							happy?  Do the systems diagrams look like a redneck family tree?</p>

							<p>If any or all of these are true, then you need Just Enough Programming
							(TM).  JEP makes liberal use of Ockham's Razor, cutting through the
							cruft and getting to the crux of the issue.  It slices.  It dices.  It
							even juliennes.  JEP fosters simplicity and elegance by seeking to
							make systems as simple as possible, but not simpler.  Its goal is to
							achieve perfection by reaching the state where we have nothing more to
							take away.  JEP is not just a methodology; it's a way of life.</p>

							<p>This session investigates why we need JEP and how it integrates with
							the enterprise through methodologies, frameworks and languages which
							enable JEP.</p>
