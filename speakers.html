						<li id="jim_weirich">
							<p><a class="name" href="http://onestepback.org/">Jim Weirich</a> is the Chief Scientist for 
							<a href="http://theedgecase.com/home">EdgeCase LLC</a>, a Rails development firm located in Columbus Ohio. Jim has 
							over twenty-five years of experience in software development. He has worked with real-time data systems for testing 
							jet engines, networking software for information systems, and image processing software for the financial industry. 
							Jim is active in the Ruby community and has contributed to several Ruby projects, including the Rake build system 
							and the RubyGems package software.</p>
							<h4>Talk: Playing it Safe - How to write library friendly code in Ruby</h4>
							<p>Ruby's incredibly flexible language features puts a great deal of responsibility on the programmer to use 
							them in a safe manner. This talk will discuss when it is appropriate to use these feature and when it might 
							be better to "play it safe".  Also discuss future language features such as "selector namespaces" and how 
							they effect programming styles.</p>

						<li id="daniel_berger">
							<p><span class="name">Daniel Berger</span> is the lead developer of several Ruby
							projects, including the Win32Utils project. He has been an active member
							in the Ruby community since 2001 and is a member of the Boulder-Denver
							Ruby user group. Daniel currently works in the telecom industry. When
							he's not writing programs, Daniel enjoys hiking, biking and playing
							board games.</p>
							<h4>Talk: New Features in Test::Unit 2.0</h4>
							<p>Did you know that Test::Unit is now available as a separate
							gem? Are you aware of its new features? This talk will be a brief
							overview of those features, as well as how and why you should use them.</p>
						<li id="michael_bleigh">
							<p><a class="name" href="http://www.mbleigh.com/">Michael Bleigh</a> is a web developer currently living near 
							Ann Arbor, MI specializing in Ruby on Rails and advanced user interface design. He is currently working for 
							<a href="http://www.intridea.com/">Intridea</a>, an agile software development firm based in Washington D.C.</p>
							<h4>Talk: Hacking the Mid-End: Advanced Rails UI Techniques</h4>
							<p>A discussion of the growing development area that lies in between the
							front and back ends of web applications using real code examples of
							advanced user interface design and construction. From Lowpro behaviors
							to block-accepting helpers and interface abstraction, the field for
							'Mid-End' developers is coming into its own right.</p>

							He works at <a href="http://zattoo.com/">Zattoo</a>, a peer-to-peer internet television company (sorry,  
							only available in Europe) here in Ann Arbor.</p>
							<h4>Talk: Metawhat?  A look into the mysterious metaclass</h4>
							<p>If you've ever seen "class&lt;&lt; self" in somebody's code and  
							wondered what the heck is going on behind the scenes, you're not  
							alone.  What you've stumbled upon is the ever-elusive metaclass (or  
							eigenclass, or singelton class... take your pick).  The metaclass is  
							shrouded in mystery, but this is mostly just because Ruby does its  
							darndest to hide it from you.  In this session, I will show you what's  
							really going on with metaclasses, and how you can use them to do  
							interesting things that are actually useful.  By the end of the  
							session, you will understand how simple and elegant using metaclasses  
							can be.</p>

							problems in Rails.</p>

								    <li>And a tool called Cucumber that executes feature document written in plain text</li>
								    <li>When you watch this presentation</li>
								    <li>Then you will gain an understanding of behavior driven development</li>
								    <li>And see examples of behavior driven development with cucumber </li>
								    <li>And be equipped to start integrating Cucumber into your development process</li>

							<h4>Talk: Using Active Scaffold</h4>
<p>When you first looked at Rails we all loved the speed of deployment. We could deploy applications faster than we ever have before. Part of this ability was to use scaffolding. However, we were then a bit disappointed to learn that we really weren't supposed to use scaffolding in production. Not only that, but scaffolding was still a bit limited. But why? This presentation will show how to use Active Scaffolding to create dynamic applications to interact with the domain. We will also go over how to customize the scaffolding for our own needs.</p>

							<h4>Talk: Predicting The Future: A Perspectives on Ruby and Rails</h4>

							<h4>Talk: Just Enough Programming</h4>
							<p>Are you tired of over architected applications?  Does infinite
							scalability imply infinite development time?  Are you surrounded by
							applications whose sole goal is to be buzzword compliant?  Do you
							suffer indigestion from the "extra sauce" that makes the management
							happy?  Do the systems diagrams look like a redneck family tree?</p>

							<p>If any or all of these are true, then you need Just Enough Programming
							(TM).  JEP makes liberal use of Ockham's Razor, cutting through the
							cruft and getting to the crux of the issue.  It slices.  It dices.  It
							even juliennes.  JEP fosters simplicity and elegance by seeking to
							make systems as simple as possible, but not simpler.  Its goal is to
							achieve perfection by reaching the state where we have nothing more to
							take away.  JEP is not just a methodology; it's a way of life.</p>

							<p>This session investigates why we need JEP and how it integrates with
							the enterprise through methodologies, frameworks and languages which
							enable JEP.</p>
