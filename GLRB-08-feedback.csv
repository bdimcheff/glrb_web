Single-track conferences are just fine, but it does limit interaction with others because people aren't up walking around/mingling as much between sessions.  And in the single-track, having several talks back to back without a break limits interaction with others as well.  I'd recommend having short breaks between each talk and/or a different venue that might make it easier to talk to others around you (auditorium limits talking to people in front or behind you IMO, and small seats prevented almost anyone from actually sitting next to anyone else - too close quarters).  Sitting next to someone at a desk/table-style room might make interacting with neighbors easier?","The food was good. I liked having individual choices of specific sandwiches for lunch.

They are different entities in my opinion.

I love ruby, hate rails.  A good rails coder should know more about ruby then they do about rails anyways.

Its time we seperated the language and the framework and let ruby grow outside of rails.  Rails will not last forever and we don't need to bring ruby down with it.

I would love to learn more ruby ""tricks"" or better programming practices.  Talking on individual applications was not really as interesting. 

I would like to see more presentations along the lines of what Jim Weirich provided.  In my opinion he made the conference and I would not plan on coming next year had he not been there this year.

","I would like to see people with better communication skills.  I have a very hard time listening to somebody that says ""umm"" after ever sentence.

* multiple tracks or sessions--so folks can choose what interests them (i.e. make some distinction between developer, designer, etc)
* Birds of a Feather session, where folks working on similar stuff have a chance to interact
* Speed Geeking--usually a one hour session where 10 - 12 people/groups do 5 minute presentations on software they've built or really like (this would have been perfect for Limelight, some of Intridea's stuff, Tarantula, etc--as well as giving the rest of us a chance to talk about what we're working on)
* Some type of discussion-based session
* Try to get more folks organized--maybe have a planning wiki, get tracks and speakers setup that way, and get a sense of what people are interested in attending
* Speakers *must* provide abstracts of talks!

","I'd say to not have the conference on a game day. My drive back to Toledo was not great.

I'm not sure if these talks were videotaped. However, if budget and manpower allow, I'd suggest to do so and put them out there. I'm sure a lot of people would benefit from the talk that Jim Weirich gave.

Another suggestion is to give away prizes during each break in action (between talks,etc.), rather than most/all at the end.
